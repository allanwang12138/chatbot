        "answer": "GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period, usually a year. It is used to measure the economic performance of a country and indicates the size of its economy. For example, if a country's GDP is $10 trillion, it means that the total value of goods and services produced in that country is $10 trillion in a year. GDP per person, or income per capita, is a measure of the average income of individuals in a country, calculated by dividing the country's GDP by its population.",

When a car suddenly stops, the passengers inside continue moving forward due to their inertia. This is because their bodies want to maintain their state of motion, resulting in the lurching forward sensation. The force of this sudden stop acts as an external force that disrupts the passengers' inertia, causing them to move forward until another force (such as a seatbelt) stops their motion.",

For example, if more people want to travel to Hawaii during the holidays, airlines may raise ticket prices to capitalize on the increased demand. This helps to allocate scarce resources efficiently by signaling consumers to consider alternatives or adjust their consumption habits.",
        "context": "An increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is a shortage and the product should perhaps\nbe economized on. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to Hawaii, but the ticket turns out to\nbe expensive during the week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the ticket might be cheaper.\nThe price could be high because you were planning to travel during a holiday when demand for traveling is high.",

        "answer": "Inflation refers to a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy. While inflation can be a sign of a growing economy, high inflation rates can erode the purchasing power of individuals and businesses, leading to reduced real incomes and lower consumption levels. Inflation can also have detrimental effects on output and economic growth by distorting resource allocation and leading to uncertainty in the economy. For example, if prices rise too rapidly, households may cut back on spending as their money buys less than before.",

High inflation can lead to a decrease in purchasing power, as the cost of goods rises faster than incomes.

When inflation occurs, the purchasing power of a unit of currency decreases, leading to a decrease in the real value of money.
