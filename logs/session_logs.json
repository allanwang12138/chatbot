        "option": "Detailed Answer",
        "answer": "Inflation refers to the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. High inflation can erode the purchasing power of consumers, leading to decreased consumption and potentially lower output. Inflation is typically measured by looking at the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Producer Price Index (PPI). For example, if the CPI shows a 2% increase from one year to the next, this would indicate a moderate level of inflation.",

        "answer": "Inflation is the overall increase in prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. It is measured by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For example, if the CPI increases by 3% in a year, it indicates there has been 3% inflation. Inflation can be caused by factors such as excessive growth in the money supply or high demand relative to supply.",
