        "question": "What is INFLATION?",
        "answer": "Inflation is when the general level of prices for goods and services in an economy rises over a period of time. This means that your money buys less than it did before. For example, if a pack of gum costs $1 today and $1.10 next year, there is inflation. High inflation can be a problem because it can reduce the purchasing power of your money.",
