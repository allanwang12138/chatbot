        "option": "Detailed Answer",
        "answer": "Inflation refers to the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. High inflation can erode the purchasing power of consumers, leading to decreased consumption and potentially lower output. Inflation is typically measured by looking at the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Producer Price Index (PPI). For example, if the CPI shows a 2% increase from one year to the next, this would indicate a moderate level of inflation.",

        "option": "Detailed Answer",
        "answer": "Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services in an economy is rising. When inflation occurs, each dollar of income will buy fewer goods and services than before. This can have negative effects on consumer purchasing power, investment decisions, and overall economic stability. To fully understand the impact of inflation on real variables like output and consumption, more complex models beyond the quantity theory need to be considered, such as the IS-LM model which incorporates inflation expectations and interest rate dynamics.",
