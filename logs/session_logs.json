        "question": "What is INFLATION?",
        "answer": "Inflation is when the general level of prices for goods and services in an economy rises over a period of time. This means that your money buys less than it did before. For example, if a pack of gum costs $1 today and $1.10 next year, there is inflation. High inflation can be a problem because it can reduce the purchasing power of your money.",

        "question": "What causes inflation?",
        "answer": "Inflation is caused by an increase in the general level of prices over time. This happens when there is a rise in the quantity of money in an economy. For example, if a government prints more money without a corresponding increase in the production of goods and services, the value of money decreases and prices go up, leading to inflation. So, changes in the money supply can have a direct impact on the inflation rate.",
