        "option": "Detailed Answer",
        "answer": "GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period, usually a year. It is used to measure the economic performance of a country and indicates the size of its economy. For example, if a country's GDP is $10 trillion, it means that the total value of goods and services produced in that country is $10 trillion in a year. GDP per person, or income per capita, is a measure of the average income of individuals in a country, calculated by dividing the country's GDP by its population.",

        "answer": "Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. It looks at things like overall production, unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. For example, if we look at the years 1880, 1900, 1920, 1940, 1960, 1980, and 2000, we can see how macroeconomics helps us understand how the economy changed over time.
