        "answer": "GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period, usually a year. It is used to measure the economic performance of a country and indicates the size of its economy. For example, if a country's GDP is $10 trillion, it means that the total value of goods and services produced in that country is $10 trillion in a year. GDP per person, or income per capita, is a measure of the average income of individuals in a country, calculated by dividing the country's GDP by its population.",

        "answer": "The concept of inertia, as described by Newton's first law of motion, states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. When a car suddenly stops, the passengers inside continue moving forward due to their inertia. This is because their bodies want to maintain their state of motion, resulting in the lurching forward sensation. The force of this sudden stop acts as an external force that disrupts the passengers' inertia, causing them to move forward until another force (such as a seatbelt) stops their motion.",
