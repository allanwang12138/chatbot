        "answer": "GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period, usually a year. It is used to measure the economic performance of a country and indicates the size of its economy. For example, if a country's GDP is $10 trillion, it means that the total value of goods and services produced in that country is $10 trillion in a year. GDP per person, or income per capita, is a measure of the average income of individuals in a country, calculated by dividing the country's GDP by its population.",

        "option": "Detailed Answer",
        "answer": "In macroeconomics, the government plays a crucial role in addressing market failures such as externalities through interventions like taxes or subsidies. However, the effectiveness of government intervention relies on its ability to identify and implement appropriate public policies. It is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of both markets and government in order to make informed decisions about economic policy. Striking a balance between market forces and government intervention is crucial to achieving efficient outcomes in the economy.",

        "option": "Detailed Answer",
        "answer": "Supply and demand are fundamental concepts in economics that determine the prices and quantities of goods and services in a market. Supply refers to the quantity of a product that sellers are willing and able to offer for sale at a given price, while demand refers to the quantity of a product that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a given price. When the supply of a product exceeds the demand, prices tend to decrease, and vice versa. For example, if there is a surplus of smartphones in the market, the price of smartphones may decrease as sellers compete to sell their products.",
