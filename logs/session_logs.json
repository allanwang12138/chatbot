        "answer": "Inflation is the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. This means that consumers have to pay more for the same amount of goods and services. For example, if the government increases spending or cuts taxes, aggregate demand may exceed the economy's capacity to produce, leading to price increases. Inflation can erode purchasing power, redistribute income, and create uncertainty in the economy.",
