        "answer": "Inflation refers to the general increase in prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. This results in a decrease in the purchasing power of a unit of currency. For example, if the government borrows money from the central bank to increase the money supply, it may lead to inflation as too much money chases too few goods, driving up prices.",

        "option": "Detailed Answer",
        "answer": "Inflation is the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. This means that consumers have to pay more for the same amount of goods and services. For example, if the government increases spending or cuts taxes, aggregate demand may exceed the economy's capacity to produce, leading to price increases. Inflation can erode purchasing power, redistribute income, and create uncertainty in the economy.",

This is because when government\nincreases spending or cuts taxes, aggregate demand increases. Firms may\nnot be able to produce higher quantities that are being demanded at the\nongoing prices.
